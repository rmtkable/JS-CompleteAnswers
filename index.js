// 1 Basic JavaScript: Comment Your JavaScript Code
//Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

// This is an in-line comment. You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:

/* This is a
multi-line comment 
Best Practice
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code—both for others and for your future self. */

// Try creating one of each type of comment.





// 2 Basic JavaScript: Declare JavaScript Variables
// In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

// For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

// Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

// Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

// We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

// var ourName;
// creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

// Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.




// 3 Basic JavaScript: Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
// In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

// myVariable = 5;

// This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

// If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

// var myVar;
// myVar = 5;
// First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

// Assign the value 7 to variable a.

// Setup
var a;

// Only change code below this line





// 4 Basic JavaScript: Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

// It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

// var myVar = 0;

// Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

// Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.





// 5 Basic JavaScript: Understanding Uninitialized Variables
// When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

// Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.


// Only change code below this line
var a;
var b;
var c;
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

// 6 Basic JavaScript: Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

// MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

// Best Practice
// Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

// Examples:

// var someVariable;
// var anotherVariableName;
// var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
// Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
// Do not create any new variables.

// Variable declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;

// 7 Basic JavaScript: Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
// Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

// Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

// JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

// Example:

// myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
// Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
var sum = 10 + 0;

// 8 Basic JavaScript: Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
// We can also subtract one number from another.

// JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

// Example

// myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
// Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
var difference = 45 - 0;

// 9 Basic JavaScript: Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
// We can also multiply one number by another.

// JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

// Example

// myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169
// Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
var product = 8 * 0;

// 10 Basic JavaScript: Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
// We can also divide one number by another.

// JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

// Example

// myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8
// Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.
var quotient = 66 / 0;


//11 Basic JavaScript: Increment a Number with JavaScript
// You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

// i++;

// is the equivalent of

// i = i + 1;

// Note
// The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

// Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;

// 12 Basic JavaScript: Decrement a Number with JavaScript
// You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

// i--;

// is the equivalent of

// i = i - 1;

// Note
// The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

// Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;

// 13 Basic JavaScript: Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
// We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

// Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).

var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

//14 Basic JavaScript: Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
// In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

// Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

// Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.
var product = 2.0 * 0.0;

// 15 Basic JavaScript: Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
// Now let's divide one decimal by another.

// Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.
var quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line

// 16 Basic JavaScript: Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
// The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

// Example

// 5 % 2 = 1 because
// Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
// 2 * 2 = 4
// 5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
// Usage
// In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

// 17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
// 48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
// Note
// The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

// Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.
// Only change code below this line

var remainder;

// 17 Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

// myVar = myVar + 5;

// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

// One such operator is the += operator.

// var myVar = 1;
// myVar += 5;
// console.log(myVar); // Returns 6
// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.




var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;

// 18 Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
// Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

// myVar = myVar - 5;

// will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

// myVar -= 5;

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;

// 19 Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
// The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

// myVar = myVar * 5;

// will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

// myVar *= 5;

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;

// 20 Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
// The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

// myVar = myVar / 5;

// Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

// myVar /= 5;

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

// 21 Basic JavaScript: Declare String Variables
// Previously we have used the code

// var myName = "your name";

// "your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

// Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.



// 22 Basic JavaScript: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
// When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

// var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

// This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

// Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".
// var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
var myStr = ""; // Change this line

// 23 Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
// In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

// Example

// 'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
// Note
// Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

// Example:

// var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
// // ourStr is "I come first. I come second."
// Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.

var myStr; // Change this line

// 24 Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
// We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

// Note
// Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

// Example:

// var ourStr = "I come first. ";
// ourStr += "I come second.";
// // ourStr is now "I come first. I come second."
// Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: "This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

var myStr;

// 25 Basic JavaScript: Constructing Strings with Variables
// Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// Example:

// var ourName = "Zorkbork";
// var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// // ourStr is now "Hello, our name is Zorkbork, how are you?"
// Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"
var myName;
var myStr;


// 26 Basic JavaScript: Appending Variables to Strings
// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

// Example:

// var anAdjective = "awesome!";
// var ourStr = "Austin is ";
// ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr is now "Austin is awesome!"
// Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.

// Change code below this line

var someAdjective;
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";

// 27 Basic JavaScript: Find the Length of a String
// You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

// "Alan Peter".length; // 10

// For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

// Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line

lastNameLength = lastName;

// 28 Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

// Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

// Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

// For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

// Example:

// var firstName = "Charles";
// var firstLetter = firstName[0]; // firstLetter is "C"
// Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

// 29 Basic JavaScript: Understand String Immutability
// In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

// For example, the following code:

// var myStr = "Bob";
// myStr[0] = "J";
// cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

// var myStr = "Bob";
// myStr = "Job";
// Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.


// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr[0] = "H"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

//30 Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

// You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

// Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

// Example:

// var firstName = "Ada";
// var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; // secondLetterOfFirstName is "d"
// Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

// 31 Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
// In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

// For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

// Example:

// var firstName = "Charles";
// var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1]; // lastLetter is "s"
// Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

// 32 Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
// You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

// For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

// Example:

// var firstName = "Charles";
// var thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3]; // thirdToLastLetter is "l"
// Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

// 33 Basic JavaScript: Word Blanks
// var wordBlanks = "the" + ' '+ myNoun +" "+ myAdjective+ " " + myVerb +" "+ myAdverb; // Change this line

// In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

// Consider this sentence - "It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____". This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

// var sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";
// In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

// You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

// You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.



var myNoun = "dog";
var myAdjective = "big";
var myVerb = "ran";
var myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
var wordBlanks = ""; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

// 34 Basic JavaScript: Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
// With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

// You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

// var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

// Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [];

// 35 Basic JavaScript: Nest one Array within Another Array
// You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

// [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]
// This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

// Create a nested array called myArray.

// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [];

// 36 Basic JavaScript: Access Array Data with Indexes
// We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

// Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


// Example

// var array = [50,60,70];
// array[0]; // equals 50
// var data = array[1]; 
// equals 60

// Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line

// 37 Basic JavaScript: Modify Array Data With Indexes
// Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.

// Example

// var ourArray = [50,40,30];
// ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]

// Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
// Setup
var myArray = [18,64,99];

// Only change code below this line

// 38 Basic JavaScript: Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
// One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

// Example

// var arr = [
//   [1,2,3],
//   [4,5,6],
//   [7,8,9],
//   [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
// ];
// arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
// arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
// arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11
// Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.
// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line
var myData = myArray[0][0];

// 39 Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With push()
// An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

// .push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
// Examples:

// var arr1 = [1,2,3];
// arr1.push(4);
// arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

// var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
// arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]

// Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.
// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line

// 40 Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With pop()
// Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

// .pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

// Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

// var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
// var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
// console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
// console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]
// Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray, assigning the "popped off" value to removedFromMyArray.
// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line
var removedFromMyArray;

// 41 Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With shift()
// pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

// That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

// Example:

// var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
// var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
// // removedFromOurArray now equals "Stimpson" and ourArray now equals ["J", ["cat"]].

// Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray, assigning the "shifted off" value to removedFromMyArray.

// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];

// Only change code below this line
var removedFromMyArray;
 
// 42 Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
// Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

// .unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

// Example:

// var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
// ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
// ourArray.unshift("Happy");
// // ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]

// Add ["Paul",35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().
// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();

// Only change code below this line



// 43 Basic JavaScript: Shopping List
// Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

// The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

// ["Chocolate Bar", 15]

// There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

var myList = [];

// 44 Basic JavaScript: Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
// In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

// Here's an example of a function:

// function functionName() {
//   console.log("Hello World");
// }
// You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

// Create a function called reusableFunction which prints "Hi World" to the dev console.
// Call the function.



// 45 Basic JavaScript: Passing Values to Functions with Arguments

// Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
// Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

// function testFun(param1, param2) {
//   console.log(param1, param2);
// }
// Then we can call testFun: testFun("Hello", "World"); We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

// Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
// Call the function with two numbers as arguments.



// 46 Basic JavaScript: Global Scope and Functions
// In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

// Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

// Using var, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

// Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword.

// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line


function fun1() {
    // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
  
  }
  
  // Only change code above this line
  
  function fun2() {
    var output = "";
    if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
      output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
    }
    if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
      output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
    }
    console.log(output);
  }


//   47 Basic JavaScript: Local Scope and Functions
// Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

// Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

// function myTest() {
//   var loc = "foo";
//   console.log(loc);
// }
// myTest(); // logs "foo"
// console.log(loc); // loc is not defined
// loc is not defined outside of the function.

// The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.
function myLocalScope() {

    // Only change code below this line
  
    console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
  }
  myLocalScope();
  
  // Run and check the console
  // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
  console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);


// 48 Basic JavaScript: Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
// It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

// In this example:

// var someVar = "Hat";
// function myFun() {
//   var someVar = "Head";
//   return someVar;
// }
// The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

// Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with "sweater".
// Setup
var outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line



  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;
}

myOutfit();

// 49 Basic JavaScript: Return a Value from a Function with Return
// We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

// Example

// function plusThree(num) {
//   return num + 3;
// }
// var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
// plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

// Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value. See the last line in the editor for an example of how you can test your timesFive function.



// 50 Basic JavaScript: Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
// A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

// Example

// var sum = 0;
// function addSum(num) {
//   sum = sum + num;
// }
// addSum(3); // sum will be modified but returned value is undefined
// addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

// Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.

// Setup
var sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line


// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();


// 51 Basic JavaScript: Assignment with a Returned Value
// If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

// Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:

// ourSum = sum(5, 12);

// will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.

// Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

// Setup
var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line


// 52 Basic JavaScript: Stand in Line
// In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

// Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.

// Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

// The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.

function nextInLine(arr, item) {
    // Only change code below this line
    
    return item;
    // Only change code above this line
    
  
  }
  
  // Setup
  var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5];
  
  // Display code
  console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
  console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 6));
  console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));

// 53 Basic JavaScript: Understanding Boolean Values
// Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

// Note
// Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

// Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.
function welcomeToBooleans() {

    // Only change code below this line
  
    return false; // Change this line
  
    // Only change code above this line
  }

//   54 Basic JavaScript: Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
// If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

// When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

// Pseudocode

// if (condition is true) {
//   statement is executed
// }
// Example

// function test (myCondition) {
//   if (myCondition) {
//      return "It was true";
//   }
//   return "It was false";
// }
// test(true);  // returns "It was true"
// test(false); // returns "It was false"
// When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns "It was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns "It was false".

// Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise.
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
  
  
    // Only change code above this line
  
  }


//   55 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Equality Operator
// There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

// The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

// function equalityTest(myVal) {
//   if (myVal == 10) {
//      return "Equal";
//   }
//   return "Not Equal";
// }
// If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal". In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

// 1   ==  1   // true
// 1   ==  2   // false
// 1   == '1'  // true
// "3" ==  3   // true
// Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12.

// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
    if (val) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  testEqual(10);



// 56 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
// Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

// If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

// Examples

// 3 ===  3   // true
// 3 === '3'  // false
// In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

// Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7
// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
    if (val) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  testStrict(10);


//   57 Basic JavaScript: Practice comparing different values
// In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

// If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

// Examples

// 3 == '3'  // returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number
// 3 === '3' // returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed
// Note
// In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:


// The compareEquality function in the editor compares two values using the equality operator. Modify the function so that it returns "Equal" only when the values are strictly equal.
// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
    if (a == b) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  compareEquality(10, "10");


//   58 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Inequality Operator
// The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

// Examples

// 1 !=  2     // true
// 1 != "1"    // false
// 1 != '1'    // false
// 1 != true   // false
// 0 != false  // false
// Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not equivalent to 99

// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
    if (val) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }
  
  testNotEqual(10);


// 59 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
// The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.

// Examples

// 3 !==  3   // false
// 3 !== '3'  // true
// 4 !==  3   // true
// Add the strict inequality operator to the if statement so the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not strictly equal to 17

// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
    if (val) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }
  
  testStrictNotEqual(10);

//   60 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
// The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

// Examples

// 5   >  3   // true
// 7   > '3'  // true
// 2   >  3   // false
// '1' >  9   // false
// Add the greater than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testGreaterThan(val) {
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "Over 100";
    }
  
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "Over 10";
    }
  
    return "10 or Under";
  }
  
  testGreaterThan(10);

// 61 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
// The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

// Examples

// 6   >=  6   // true
// 7   >= '3'  // true
// 2   >=  3   // false
// '7' >=  9   // false
// Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "20 or Over";
    }
  
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "10 or Over";
    }
  
    return "Less than 10";
  }
  
  testGreaterOrEqual(10);

//   62 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Less Than Operator
// The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.

// Examples

// 2   < 5  // true
// '3' < 7  // true
// 5   < 5  // false
// 3   < 2  // false
// '8' < 4  // false

// Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.
function testLessThan(val) {
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "Under 25";
    }
  
    if (val) {  // Change this line
      return "Under 55";
    }
  
    return "55 or Over";
  }
  
  testLessThan(10);

//   63 Basic JavaScript: Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
// The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than or equal to converts data types.

// Examples

// 4   <= 5  // true
// '7' <= 7  // true
// 5   <= 5  // true
// 3   <= 2  // false
// '8' <= 4  // false
// Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testLessOrEqual(val) {

  }

//   64 Basic JavaScript: Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
// Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

// The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:

// if (num > 5) {
//   if (num < 10) {
//     return "Yes";
//   }
// }
// return "No";
// will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:

// if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
//   return "Yes";
// }
// return "No";
// Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return "Yes" if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return "No".


function testLogicalAnd(val) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
    if (val) {

  }
  
  testLogicalAnd(10);

//   65 Basic JavaScript: Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
// The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

// The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

// if (num > 10) {
//   return "No";
// }
// if (num < 5) {
//   return "No";
// }
// return "Yes";
// will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

// if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
//   return "No";
// }
// return "Yes";
// Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns "Outside" if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return "Inside".

  }
  
  testLogicalOr(15);

//   66 Basic JavaScript: Introducing Else Statements
// When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

// if (num > 10) {
//   return "Bigger than 10";
// } else {
//   return "10 or Less";
// }
// Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.

//   68 Basic JavaScript: Logical Order in If Else Statements
// Order is important in if, else if statements.

// The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

// Take these two functions as an example.

// Here's the first:

// function foo(x) {
//   if (x < 1) {
//     return "Less than one";
//   } else if (x < 2) {
//     return "Less than two";
//   } else {
//     return "Greater than or equal to two";
//   }
// }
// And the second just switches the order of the statements:

// function bar(x) {
//   if (x < 2) {
//     return "Less than two";
//   } else if (x < 1) {
//     return "Less than one";
//   } else {
//     return "Greater than or equal to two";
//   }
// }
// While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

// foo(0) // "Less than one"
// bar(0) // "Less than two"
// Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.
function orderMyLogic(val) {
    if (val < 10) {

// 70  Basic JavaScript: Golf Code
// In the game of golf each hole has a par meaning the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in a hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

// Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

// Strokes	Return
// 1	"Hole-in-one!"

// par - 1	"Birdie"
// par	"Par"
// par + 1	"Bogey"
// par + 2	"Double Bogey"

// 71 Basic JavaScript: Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
// If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

// Here is an example of a switch statement:

// switch(lowercaseLetter) {
//   case "a":
//     console.log("A");
//     break;
//   case "b":
//     console.log("B");
//     break;
// }
// case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

// Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
// 1 - "alpha"
// 2 - "beta"
// 3 - "gamma"
// 4 - "delta"


function caseInSwitch(val) {
    var answer = "";
    // Only change code below this line

  // 72 Basic JavaScript: Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
  // In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.
  
  // A default statement should be the last case.
  
  // switch (num) {
  //   case value1:

  // 73 Basic JavaScript: Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
  // If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

  //   case 1:
  //   case 2:
  //   case 3:
  //     result = "1, 2, or 3";
  //     break;
  //   case 4:
  //     result = "4 alone";
  // }
  // Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.
  
  // Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
  // 1-3 - "Low"
  // 4-6 - "Mid"
  // 7-9 - "High"
  
  // Note
  // You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.

  // 75 Basic JavaScript: Returning Boolean Values from Functions
  // You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.
  
  // Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:
  
  // function isEqual(a,b) {
  //   if (a === b) {
  //     return true;
  //   } else {
  //     return false;
  //   }
  // }
  // But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:
  
  // function isEqual(a,b) {
  //   return a === b;
  // }
  // Fix the function isLess to remove the if/else statements.
  
  function isLess(a, b) {
    // Only change code below this line
    if (a < b) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  isLess(10, 15);
  
  
  // 76 Basic JavaScript: Return Early Pattern for Functions
  // When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.
  
  // Example
  
  // function myFun() {
  //   console.log("Hello");
  //   return "World";
  //   console.log("byebye")
  // }
  // myFun();
  // The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.
  
  // Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.
  
  // Hint
  // Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.
  // Setup
  function abTest(a, b) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
  
  
    // Only change code above this line
  
    return Math.round(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(a) + Math.sqrt(b), 2));
  }
  
  abTest(2,2);
  
  // 77 Basic JavaScript: Counting Cards
  // In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.
  
  // Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.
  
  // Count Change	Cards
  // +1
  // 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  // 0
  // 7, 8, 9
  // -1	
  // 10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
  // You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.
  
  // Example Output
  // -3 Hold
  // 5 Bet
  
  // Hint
  // Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
  // Do NOT return an array.
  // Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.
  var count = 0;
  
  function cc(card) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
  
    return "Change Me";
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');
   
  // 78 Basic JavaScript: Build JavaScript Objects
  // You may have heard the term object before.
  
  // Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
  
  // Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
  
  // Here's a sample cat object:
  
  // var cat = {
  //   "name": "Whiskers",
  //   "legs": 4,
  //   "tails": 1,
  //   "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
  // };
  // In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:
  
  // var anotherObject = {
  //   make: "Ford",
  //   5: "five",
  //   "model": "focus"
  // };
  // However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
  
  // Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".
  
  // You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.\
  
  var myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    
    
    // Only change code above this line
    };
  
  
  // 79 Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
  // There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.
  
  // Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
  
  // Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:
  
  // var myObj = {
  //   prop1: "val1",
  //   prop2: "val2"
  // };
  // var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
  // var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
  // Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.
  // Setup
  var testObj = {
    "hat": "ballcap",
    "shirt": "jersey",
    "shoes": "cleats"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  var hatValue = testObj;      // Change this line
  var shirtValue = testObj;    // Change this line
  
  // 80 Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
  // The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
  
  // However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.
  
  // Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:
  
  // var myObj = {
  //   "Space Name": "Kirk",
  //   "More Space": "Spock",
  //   "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
  // };
  // myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
  // myObj['More Space']; // Spock
  // myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
  // Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).
  
  // Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.
  
  // Setup
  var testObj = {
    "an entree": "hamburger",
    "my side": "veggies",
    "the drink": "water"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  var entreeValue = testObj;   // Change this line
  var drinkValue = testObj;    // Change this line
  
  
  // 81 Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Variables
  // Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
  
  // Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:
  
  // var dogs = {
  //   Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
  // };
  // var myDog = "Hunter";
  // var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
  // console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
  // Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:
  
  // var someObj = {
  //   propName: "John"
  // };
  // function propPrefix(str) {
  //   var s = "prop";
  //   return s + str;
  // }
  // var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
  // console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
  // Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.
  
  // Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player.
  // Setup
  var testObj = {
    12: "Namath",
    16: "Montana",
    19: "Unitas"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  var playerNumber;       // Change this line
  var player = testObj;   // Change this line
  
  // 82 Basic JavaScript: Updating Object Properties
  // After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.
  
  // For example, let's look at ourDog:
  
  // var ourDog = {
  //   "name": "Camper",
  //   "legs": 4,
  //   "tails": 1,
  //   "friends": ["everything!"]
  // };
  // Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper". Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".
  
  // Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.
  
  // Setup
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["Coding Campers"]
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  
  // 83 Basic JavaScript: Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
  // You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.
  
  // Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:
  
  // ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
  
  // or
  
  // ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
  
  // Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".
  
  // Example:
  
  // var ourDog = {
  //   "name": "Camper",
  //   "legs": 4,
  //   "tails": 1,
  //   "friends": ["everything!"]
  // };
  
  // ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
  // Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.
  // Setup
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["Coding Campers"]
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  
  // 84 Basic JavaScript: Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
  // We can also delete properties from objects like this:
  
  // delete ourDog.bark;
  
  // Example:
  
  // var ourDog = {
  //   "name": "Camper",
  //   "legs": 4,
  //   "tails": 1,
  //   "friends": ["everything!"],
  //   "bark": "bow-wow"
  // };
  
  // delete ourDog.bark;
  // After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:
  
  // {
  //   "name": "Camper",
  //   "legs": 4,
  //   "tails": 1,
  //   "friends": ["everything!"]
  // }
  // Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.
  // Setup
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
    "bark": "woof"
  };

  // 85 Basic JavaScript: Using Objects for Lookups
  // Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.
  
  // Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:
  
  // var alpha = {
  //   1:"Z",
  //   2:"Y",
  //   3:"X",
  //   4:"W",
  //   ...
  //   24:"C",
  //   25:"B",
  //   26:"A"
  // };
  // alpha[2]; // "Y"
  // alpha[24]; // "C"
  
  // var value = 2;
  // alpha[value]; // "Y"
  // Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.
  
  // Setup
  function phoneticLookup(val) {
    var result = "";
  
    // Only change code below this line
    switch(val) {
      case "alpha":
        result = "Adams";
        break;
      case "bravo":
        result = "Boston";
        break;
      case "charlie":
        result = "Chicago";
        break;
      case "delta":
        result = "Denver";
        break;
      case "echo":
        result = "Easy";
        break;
      case "foxtrot":
        result = "Frank";
    }
  
    // Only change code above this line
    return result;
  }
  
  phoneticLookup("charlie");
   
  //86 Basic JavaScript: Testing Objects for Properties
  // Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.
  
  // Example
  
  // var myObj = {
  //   top: "hat",
  //   bottom: "pants"
  // };
  // myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
  // myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false
  // Modify the function checkObj to test if an object passed to the function (obj) contains a specific property (checkProp). If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found".
  function checkObj(obj, checkProp) {
    // Only change code below this line
    return "Change Me!";
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  // 87 Basic JavaScript: Manipulating Complex Objects
  // Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.
  
  // Here's an example of a complex data structure:
  
  // var ourMusic = [
  //   {
  //     "artist": "Daft Punk",
  //     "title": "Homework",
  //     "release_year": 1997,
  //     "formats": [ 
  //       "CD", 
  //       "Cassette", 
  //       "LP"
  //     ],
  //     "gold": true
  //   }
  // ];
  // This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk". JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.
  
  // {
  //   "artist": "Daft Punk",
  //   "title": "Homework",
  //   "release_year": 1997,
  //   "formats": [ 
  //     "CD",
  //     "Cassette",
  //     "LP"
  //   ],
  //   "gold": true
  // }
  // Note
  // You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.
  
  // Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.
  
  var myMusic = [
    {
      "artist": "Billy Joel",
      "title": "Piano Man",
      "release_year": 1973,
      "formats": [
        "CD",
        "8T",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    }
    // Add a record here
  ];
  
  
  // 88 Basic JavaScript: Accessing Nested Objects
  // The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
  
  // Here is a nested object:
  
  // var ourStorage = {
  //   "desk": {
  //     "drawer": "stapler"
  //   },
  //   "cabinet": {
  //     "top drawer": { 
  //       "folder1": "a file",
  //       "folder2": "secrets"
  //     },
  //     "bottom drawer": "soda"
  //   }
  // };
  // ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;  // "secrets"
  // ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"
  // Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation.
  
  
  // Setup
  var myStorage = {
    "car": {
      "inside": {
        "glove box": "maps",
        "passenger seat": "crumbs"
       },
      "outside": {
        "trunk": "jack"
      }
    }
  };
  
  var gloveBoxContents = undefined; // Change this line
  
  // 89 Basic JavaScript: Accessing Nested Arrays
  // As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, Array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.
  
  // Here is an example of how to access a nested array:
  
  // var ourPets = [
  //   {
  //     animalType: "cat",
  //     names: [
  //       "Meowzer",
  //       "Fluffy",
  //       "Kit-Cat"
  //     ]
  //   },
  //   {
  //     animalType: "dog",
  //     names: [
  //       "Spot",
  //       "Bowser",
  //       "Frankie"
  //     ]
  //   }
  // ];
  // ourPets[0].names[1]; // "Fluffy"
  // ourPets[1].names[0]; // "Spot"
  // Retrieve the second tree from the variable myPlants using object dot and array bracket notation.
  // Setup
  var myPlants = [
    {
      type: "flowers",
      list: [
        "rose",
        "tulip",
        "dandelion"
      ]
    },
    {

  // 90 Basic JavaScript: Record Collection
  // You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.
  
  // You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object like collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.
  
  // Your function must always return the entire object.
  // If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.
  // If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
  // If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
  // If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
  // Note: A copy of the collection object is used for the tests.
  // Setup
  var collection = {
    2548: {
      albumTitle: 'Slippery When Wet',

  // 91 Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
  // You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
  
  // The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
  
  // var ourArray = [];
  // var i = 0;
  // while(i < 5) {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  //   i++;
  // }
  // In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.
  
  // Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.
  
  // Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.
  // Setup
  var myArray = [];
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  // 92 Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
  // You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
  
  // The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs "for" a specific number of times.
  
  // For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
  
  // for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])
  
  // The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.
  
  // The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.
  
  // The final-expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.
  
  // In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final-expression.
  
  // var ourArray = [];
  // for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  // }
  // ourArray will now contain [0,1,2,3,4].
  
  // Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.
  
  
  // Setup
  var myArray = [];
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  // 93 Basic JavaScript: Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
  // For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.
  
  // We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.
  
  // var ourArray = [];
  // for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  // }
  // ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8]. Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.
  
  // Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.
  // Setup

  // Only change code below this line
  
  
  // 94 Basic JavaScript: Count Backwards With a For Loop
  // A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.
  
  // In order to count backwards by twos, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final-expression.
  
  // We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.
  
  // var ourArray = [];
  // for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  // }
  // ourArray will now contain [10,8,6,4,2]. Let's change our initialization and final-expression so we can count backward by twos by odd numbers.

  // 95 Basic JavaScript: Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
  // A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:
  
  // var arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];
  // for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  //    console.log(arr[i]);
  // }
  // Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case the last iteration is i === 4 i.e. when i becomes equal to arr.length and outputs 6 to the console.
  
  // Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.
  
  // Setup
  var myArr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

  // 96 Basic JavaScript: Nesting For Loops
  // If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:
  
  // var arr = [
  //   [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
  // ];
  // for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  //   for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
  //     console.log(arr[i][j]);
  //   }
  // }
  // This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.
  
  // Modify function multiplyAll so that it returns the product of all the numbers in the sub-arrays of arr.
  
  
  function multiplyAll(arr) {
    var product = 1;
    // Only change code below this line
  
    // Only change code above this line
    return product;
  }
  
  multiplyAll([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]);
  
  // 97 Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
  // The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.
  
  // var ourArray = [];
  // var i = 0;
  // do {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  //   i++;
  // } while (i < 5);
  // The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action: Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:
  
  // var ourArray = []; 
  // var i = 5;
  // while (i < 5) {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  //   i++;
  // }
  // In this example, we initialize the value of ourArray to an empty array and the value of i to 5. When we execute the while loop, the condition evaluates to false because i is not less than 5, so we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that ourArray will end up with no values added to it, and it will still look like [] when all of the code in the example above has completed running. Now, take a look at a do...while loop:
  
  // var ourArray = []; 
  // var i = 5;
  // do {
  //   ourArray.push(i);
  //   i++;
  // } while (i < 5);
  // In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5]. Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once. Let's try getting a do...while loop to work by pushing values to an array.
  
  // Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.
  
  // Setup
  var myArray = [];
  var i = 10;
  
  // Only change code below this line
  while (i < 5) {
    myArray.push(i);
    i++;
  }
  
  // 98 Basic JavaScript: Replace Loops using Recursion
  // Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. Using a for loop, you could do this:
  
  //   function multiply(arr, n) {
  //     var product = 1;
  //     for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  //         product *= arr[i];
  //     }
  //     return product;
  //   }
  // However, notice that multiply(arr, n) == multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1]. That means you can rewrite multiply in terms of itself and never need to use a loop.
  
  //   function multiply(arr, n) {
  //     if (n <= 0) {
  //       return 1;
  //     } else {
  //       return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
  //     }
  //   }
  // The recursive version of multiply breaks down like this. In the base case, where n <= 0, it returns 1. For larger values of n, it calls itself, but with n - 1. That function call is evaluated in the same way, calling multiply again until n <= 0. At this point, all the functions can return and the original multiply returns the answer.
  
  // Note: Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.
  
  // Write a recursive function, sum(arr, n), that returns the sum of the first n elements of an array arr.
  
  function sum(arr, n) {
    // Only change code below this line
  
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  // 99 Basic JavaScript: Profile Lookup
  // We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.
  
  // A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.
  
  // The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.
  
  // If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.
  
  // If name does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact".
  
  // If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return "No such property".
  // Setup
  var contacts = [

  // 100 Basic JavaScript: Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
  // Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.
  
  // JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1
  
  // Note
  // Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.
  
  // Change randomFraction to return a random number instead of returning 0.
  function randomFraction() {
  
    // Only change code below this line
  
    return 0;
  
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  // 101 Basic JavaScript: Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
  // It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.
  
  // Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
  // Multiply that random decimal by 20.
  // Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
  // Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.
  
  // Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:
  
  // Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
  
  // We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.
  
  // Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between 0 and 9.
  function randomWholeNum() {
  
    // Only change code below this line
  
    return Math.random();
  }
  
  // 102 Basic JavaScript: Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
  // Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.
  
  // To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.
  
  // Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:
  
  // Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
  
  // Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.
  
  function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
    // Only change code below this line
    return 0;
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  // 103 Basic JavaScript: Use the parseInt Function
  // The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. Here's an example:
  
  // var a = parseInt("007");
  
  // The above function converts the string "007" to an integer 7. If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.
  
  // Use parseInt() in the convertToInteger function so it converts the input string str into an integer, and returns it.
  function convertToInteger(str) {
  
  }
  
  convertToInteger("56");
  
  // 104 Basic JavaScript: Use the parseInt Function with a Radix
  // The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.
  
  // The function call looks like:
  
  // parseInt(string, radix);
  
  // And here's an example:
  
  // var a = parseInt("11", 2);
  
  // The radix variable says that "11" is in the binary system, or base 2. This example converts the string "11" to an integer 3.
  
  // Use parseInt() in the convertToInteger function so it converts a binary number to an integer and returns it.
  function convertToInteger(str) {
  
  }
  
  convertToInteger("10011");
  
  // 105 Basic JavaScript: Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator
  // The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.
  
  // The syntax is:
  
  // condition ? expression-if-true : expression-if-false;
  
  // The following function uses an if-else statement to check a condition:
  
  // function findGreater(a, b) {
  //   if(a > b) {
  //     return "a is greater";
  //   }
  //   else {
  //     return "b is greater";
  //   }
  // }
  // This can be re-written using the conditional operator:
  
  // function findGreater(a, b) {
  //   return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
  // }
  // Use the conditional operator in the checkEqual function to check if two numbers are equal or not. The function should return either "Equal" or "Not Equal".
  
  function checkEqual(a, b) {
  
  }
  
  checkEqual(1, 2);
  
  // 106 Basic JavaScript: Use Recursion to Create a Countdown
  // In a previous challenge, you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.
  
  // As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.
  
  // For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:
  
  // function countup(n) {
  //   if (n < 1) {
  //     return [];
  //   } else {
  //     const countArray = countup(n - 1);
  //     countArray.push(n);
  //     return countArray;
  //   }
  // }
  // console.log(countup(5)); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  // At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].
  
  // We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
  
  // Only change code below this line
  function countdown(n){
    return;
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  
  
  
  // 107 Basic JavaScript: Use Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers
  // Continuing from the previous challenge, we provide you another opportunity to create a recursive function to solve a problem.
  
  // We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.
  function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
    return [];
  };
